## What is Cuckoo ?

Cuckoo is a open source **slackbot** directed to companies and work teams that uses Slack to communicate. It focuses on **storing your important Slack Posts** in one place so that you donâ€™t miss a thing. 

<br/>

<h1 align="center"><i>Keep your team in sync!</i></h1>

<h3>How it works? ðŸ¤”</h3>
<p>- With Cuckoo you can create <b>events or announcements</b> that will be published on the platform's "Cuckoos feed" where you can find all the posts previously published by other members of your organisation.</p>
<p>- These posts will also be sent to a channel on your <b>slack workspace</b>, depending on their category. A <b>reminder</b> will also be sent 1 day before the event starts.</p>
<p>- Events will go into a <b>collective calendar</b>. This way you will quickly have access to what will be happening in the following days, so that you donâ€™t miss a thing.</p>

<h3>3. Setup the App</h3>
  
<p>- Go to <i>Settings/Basic Information/App Credentials</i> and look for the following information to add to the respective files:<p>
  
In `client/.env`:
  
```
REACT_APP_SLACK_CLIENT_ID = 
```

<p>- Now, complete the file with the requested information:<p>
 
  
```
REACT_APP_SLACK_REDIRECT_URL = https://yourFrontend.com/api/v1/auth/slack
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL = http://localhost:8000 (to run it locally)
```

##
  
In `server/.env`:
```
//found on Basic Information/App Credentials
/*-----------------------------------------*/    
SLACK_CLIENT_ID = 
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET =
/*-----------------------------------------*/  
  
FRONTEND_HOST = https://yourFrontend.com
  
SLACK_OAUTH_TOKEN = ?
SLACK_API_TOKEN = ?
```
To get this tokens (`SLACK_OAUTH_TOKEN` and `SLACK_API_TOKEN`) you need to install the App on your workspace.
  
For that, go to <i>Settings/OAuth & Permissions</i> and follow the next steps:
  
- Add a **Redirect URL** that should be something like: 'https://yourFrontend.com/api/v1/auth/slack'

- Insert the **Bot and User Token Scopes** specified below:

- **Install the App** on your Workspace by pressing the button

Now you can past the generated tokens to the file `server/.env`:
  
```
SLACK_OAUTH_TOKEN = User OAuth Token
SLACK_API_TOKEN = Bot User OAuth Token
```
