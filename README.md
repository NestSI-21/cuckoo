## What is Cuckoo ?

Cuckoo is a open source slackbot directed to companies and work teams that uses Slack to communicate. It focuses on storing your important Slack Posts in one place so that you donâ€™t miss a thing.

<h3>How it works? ðŸ¤”</h3>
<p>- With Cuckoo you can create <b>events or announcements</b> that will be published on the platform's "Cuckoos feed" where you can find all the posts previously published by other members of your organisation.</p>
<p>- These posts will also be sent to a channel on your <b>slack workspace</b>, depending on their category. A <b>reminder</b> will also be sent 1 day before the event starts.</p>
<p>- Events will go into a <b>collective calendar</b>. This way you will quickly have access to what will be happening in the following days, so that you donâ€™t miss a thing.</p>
